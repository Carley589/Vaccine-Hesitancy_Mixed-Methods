# Journey of Decisions: Understanding Parental Perspectives on Vaccine Hesitancy and Decision-Making Approaches in Childhood Vaccinations

## Abstract
Once the leading cause of death, especially among children, infectious diseases have drastically declined due to widespread vaccination, yet vaccine hesitancy remains a major public health challenge, worsened by the recent pandemic. This explanatory sequential mixed-methods study aimed to examine the factors influencing vaccine hesitancy among parents of children under 18, employing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to enhance future research practices. The study's objectives were to quantitatively assess whether decision-making styles predict vaccine hesitancy, considering demographic factors, and to qualitatively explore the underlying perspectives contributing to vaccine hesitancy.

A survey of 260 parents revealed that those with an intuitive decision-making style had 86% lower odds of being vaccine-hesitant, while parents with three or more children had 73% lower odds of exhibiting vaccine hesitancy. However, the sample's homogeneity limits the generalizability of these findings. The qualitative phase, involving 17 semi-structured interviews with 18 participants, was analyzed using both traditional reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) with NVivo and AI-assisted RTA with ChatGPT. The study found that traditional RTA provided deeper and more comprehensive insights, with consistent coding, in-depth participant quotes, and a rigorous iterative process, making it more effective in addressing the research questions. While AI-driven RTAs were efficient and satisfactory in identifying themes, they lacked the depth of traditional RTA. However, AI's capacity to perform analyses within minutes and its cost-efficiency, compared to the significant time and expenses associated with traditional reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) using NVivo, underscores its potential as a valuable co-researcher, especially for those working with limited resources.

This study underscores the importance of thoroughly exploring vaccine hesitancy, decision-making styles, and underlying beliefs while also contributing to the evolving discourse on AI's role in qualitative research.
